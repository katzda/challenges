# Memory Game "Sequential Seating Saga"
### Setup:

Imaginary circular table with 'n' seats, initially starting from seat 1.
Real people sit in a circle and add imaginary people to the table.
### Objective:

Participants aim to correctly enumerate all the people seated at the table along with associated information without making mistakes.
### Gameplay:

Participants take turns adding imaginary people to the table, assigning them random names.
Existing individuals are recalled from memory in order, starting from the first seat, whenever a new person is added.
When the table becomes full, the new person replaces the oldest imaginary person seated.
### Increasing Difficulty:

Additional information (e.g., fruits, countries, animals) can be associated with each person as the game progresses.
Once all people have four pieces of associated information, the difficulty can increase by adding more seats or restarting with names-only.
### Elimination Rules:

If a participant fails to correctly enumerate the details for a personality three times in a row, they are eliminated from the game.
Upon failure, the personality they were going to add remains for the next person, and a random personality generator is handed over to the next participant.
### Game End and Winner:

The game continues until only one participant remains or until a predetermined endpoint (e.g., a set number of rounds) is reached.
The last remaining participant or the player with the highest score (if counting eliminations) wins.

## Counting Eliminations with Bad Points:
### Bad Points System:

Each time a participant fails to correctly enumerate the details for a personality, they receive a "bad point."
If a player accumulates two "bad points" (fails twice), they are at risk of elimination.
### Redemption of Bad Points:

If a participant succeeds in correctly recalling the details for a personality after receiving "bad points," they can redeem one or both of these "bad points."
For instance, if they had accumulated two "bad points" and then succeed, they could reduce their count of "bad points" back to zero or one.
### Elimination Threshold:

If a player accumulates a total of three "bad points" (fails three times without redemption), they are eliminated from the game.
### Gameplay Continuation:

Participants who manage to redeem their "bad points" by correctly recalling details can stay in the game longer, even after making mistakes.
The game continues until only one participant remains or until a predetermined endpoint (e.g., a set number of rounds) is reached.
### Winner Determination:

The last remaining participant or the player with the highest score (fewest "bad points") at the end of the game wins.
