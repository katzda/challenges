H11 is the input Z and is designated Hie (input Z common emitter.)
H21 is Hfe the ratio of collector current to base current, common emitter
H22 is Hoe, the output admittance. The ratio of collector current to collector voltage common emitter.
H12 is reverse voltage gain. The ratio of Signal at the input to the signal at the output.

transistor's
imput impedance: Z = Hie
Current gain: Ai = hfe
voltage gain: Av = -(Hfe*Rl)/Hie
Output impedance: Zout = 1/Hoe
thes are only used to calc some predections about an existing circuit given we know the H parameters.
But there wasnt an example how to determine values for resistors

3000 => 1418  uA
2000 => 1.414 mA
1000 => 1.846 mA
500 =>  2.019 mA
200 =>  2.129 mA
100 =>  2.166 mA
50 =>   2.21  mA
10 =>   2.222 mA
1 =>    2.247 mA
0.1 =>  2.221 mA

collector current
C2 | Rl-S    => 27.18 mA (197 - 170)
C2 | Re      => 73.85 mA (217 - 143)
C2 | Re      => 73.85 mA (217 - 143)

current on speaker without C3: 6.673 (158-151)

topology
c3 | Rl-S  => 0.02mA                # 100m
c3 | Rl    => 29.36  (169-140)      # 100m

Capacitance
c3 | Rl    => ~7     (158-151)      # 1u
c3 | Rl    => ~7     (158-151)      # 10u
c3 | Rl    => 18.8   (164.4-145.6)  # 100u
c3 | Rl    => 25     (167.3-142.3)  # 200u
c3 | Rl    => 27     (168.3-141.2)  # 200u
c3 | Rl    => 27     (168.3-141.2)  # 300u
c3 | Rl    => 28.6   (169.1-140.5)  # 500u

voltage difference on speaker: 0.3
